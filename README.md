============

## Brief
My standard *nix dot files.

## What's going on here
George Seurat made dot paintings (we have a few hanging in Chicago) and I am
quite certain that if he would have been writing code instead of painting
pictures he would have some mighty dot files. Most of the code and cleverness
here was ruthlessly stolen from my friends at the UIUC ACM.

## Code & Go

<pre><code> $ sudo ./install -f </code></pre>
